## Function documentation
`getEpochTime` returns the unix epoch, which are the seconds elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970 (leap seconds are ignored, every day is treated as having 86400 seconds). **Attention**: If you have set a time offset this time offset will be added to your epoch timestamp.
